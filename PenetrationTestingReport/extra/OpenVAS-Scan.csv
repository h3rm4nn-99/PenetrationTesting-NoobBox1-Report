192.168.64.21,,80,tcp,5.8,Medium,"WillNotFix","WordPress User IDs and User Names Disclosure","WordPress platforms use a parameter called `author'. This parameter
  accepts integer values and represents the `User ID' of users in the
  web site. For example: http://www.example.com/?author=1","The following user names were revealed in id range 1-25.

  1. The query response discloses whether the User ID is enabled.

  2. The query response leaks (by redirection) the User Name
  corresponding with that User ID.","No known solution was made available for at least one year since the disclosure of this vulnerability.
  Likely none will be provided anymore. General solution options are to upgrade to a newer release, disable respective features, remove the
  product or replace the product by another one.","","The problems found are:

  1. User ID values are generated consecutively.

  2. When a valid User ID is found, WordPress redirects to a web page
  with the name of the author.","

  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timestamps=disabled'

  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be completely disabled.

  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the Timestamp options when
  initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP peer that is initiating communication includes
  them in their synchronize (SYN) segment.
